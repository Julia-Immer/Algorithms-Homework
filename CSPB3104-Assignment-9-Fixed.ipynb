I believe the probability of a given mutation would be: 1/$2^{-k^2}$ for k changes. In this case it would be inversely proportional.  I can see how the problem wouldn't work if we had the true probability as the weight though (We would then want to find the maximum spanning tree to find the most likely changes)."
