Each email graph will have the starting node be the sender and the time the email is sent, and the end node be the receiver and the time they opened the graph.  Label the nodes if they are senders or receivers.  This will be our forest of emails and it will have 2*|E| nodes, taking theta(|E|) time to create.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a single infection node for the CEO at t = 0.  From this node connect all of the email nodes the ceo sent out after t = 0. Let each of the new edges be weighted with the difference between 0 and tk.  I included a picture of my graph and here the ceo sends out only 3 emails.  I colored sender nodes as turquoise and receiver nodes as purple. The blue arrows are an email edge, one that connects sender and receiver.  And the red ring around the CEO's first node signifies his infected email box.\n",
    "\n",

The weight is the difference, t_receiver minus t_s.  For example, the upper left hand yellow edge from the CEO (P_0) has a weight of 0.  The middle edge from the CEO has a weight of 2 - 0 = 2.  These edges are colored yellow in the diagram.\n",
